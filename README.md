# checkm8gui

checkm8gui is an application for macOS and Linux which will adapt the [ipwndfu](https://github.com/axi0mx/ipwndfu/) command-line tool by [axi0mX](https://twitter.com/axi0mx/) to a graphical application.

## Estimated release date

checkm8gui is still in development. No public commits will be made until a working application has been completed. Once this first commit has been released, bugs will be fixed as they are reported or found by me. The estimated release date for checkm8gui is October 8th, 2019.
